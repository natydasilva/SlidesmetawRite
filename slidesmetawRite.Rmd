## <span style="color:#88398A">Motivation</span> 

- Systematic reviews are used to understand how treatments are effective and to design disease control policies
- Systematic reviews often include a meta-analysis that summarizes the findings of multiple studies. 

-Reviews should be updated quickly as new scientific information becomes available

-Living systematic reviews have been proposed as a new approach to dealing with this problem.

## <span style="color:#88398A">LSR</span> 

-Enable rapid updating of systematic reviews as new research becomes available

-Ensuring a transparent process

-Reproducible review

## <span style="color:#88398A">Our approach to LSR</span> 

-Implemented in an R package named metawRite

-Goal is to combine writing and analysis of the review, allowing versioning and updating in an R package . 


metawRite package will allow an easy and effective way to display a living systematic review available in a web-based display. 


## <span style="color:#88398A">Main tasks in a LSR</span> 


Main tasks to have an effective living systematic review:

-Ability to produce dynamic reports

-Availability online with an interface that enables end users to understand the data

-Ability to efficiently update the review (and any meta-analysis) with new research (Elliott et al. 2014).


<!-- metawRite package will cover these three task integrated in a friendly web based environment for the final user. This package is not a new meta-analysis package instead will be flexible enough to read different output models from the most used meta-analysis packages in R (metafor (Viechtbauer 2010), meta (Schwarzer 2007) among others), organize the information and display the results in an user driven interactive dashboard. The main function of this package will display a modern web-based application for update a living systematic review. This package combines the power of R, shiny (Chang et al. 2017) and knitr (Xie 2015) to get a dynamic reports and up to date meta-analysis results remaining user friendly. The package has the potential to be used by a large number of groups that conduct and update systematic review such as What Works clearinghouse (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/WWC/) which reviews education interventions, Campbell Collaboration https://www.campbellcollaboration.org that includes reviews on topics such as social and criminal justice issues and many other social science topics, the Collaboration for Environment Evidence (http://www.environmentalevidence.org) and food production and security (http://www.syreaf.org) among others. -->
