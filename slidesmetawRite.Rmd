## <span style="color:#88398A">Structure</span> 
- Motivation

- what are living systematic reviews (LSR)?

- our solution: `metawRite`

- Future Work

## <span style="color:#88398A">Systematic reviews ... </span> 

-  summarize findings of multiple studies on a specific topic/problem,  often include a meta-analysis 

-  used to understand which treatments are effective and how different treatments compare

- used to inform disease control policies

- ***have to be updated*** as new scientific information becomes available

**Living systematic reviews** have been proposed as an approach to speed up the update

## <span style="color:#88398A">LSR</span> 

- Enable ***rapid update*** of systematic reviews as new research becomes available

- Ensuring a ***transparent process***

- ***Reproducibility*** of reviews

## <span style="color:#88398A">Main tasks in a LSR</span> 

- ability to produce dynamic reports

-  online availability with an interface that enables end users to understand the data

- ability to efficiently update the review (and any meta-analysis) with new research (Elliott et al. 2014).

## <span style="color:#88398A">Our approach to LSR</span> 

- Implemented in an R package named **metawRite**

- Goal is to combine writing and analysis of the review, allowing versioning and updating in an R package . 


**metawRite** package allows an easy and effective way to display a living systematic review available in a web-based display. 



## <span style="color:#88398A">Functionality </span>

- Helper functions to run meta-analysis models, restructure the data to be used in a web app
- Shiny app function to write, review and update LSR
- Translate some plots from **metafor** to ggplot2 framework

## <span style="color:#88398A">Functionalities </span>

Main function runs a shiny app with

```{r echo=TRUE, eval =FALSE}
upreportdashoard(initialprotocol = TRUE, initialreport = TRUE,
                 pair = TRUE, net = FALSE, data = initialdt, 
                 outputformat = "pdf")
```

<!-- metawRite package will cover these three task integrated in a friendly web based environment for the final user. This package is not a new meta-analysis package instead will be flexible enough to read different output models from the most used meta-analysis packages in R (metafor (Viechtbauer 2010), meta (Schwarzer 2007) among others), organize the information and display the results in an user driven interactive dashboard. The main function of this package will display a modern web-based application for update a living systematic review. This package combines the power of R, shiny (Chang et al. 2017) and knitr (Xie 2015) to get a dynamic reports and up to date meta-analysis results remaining user friendly. The package has the potential to be used by a large number of groups that conduct and update systematic review such as What Works clearinghouse (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/WWC/) which reviews education interventions, Campbell Collaboration https://www.campbellcollaboration.org that includes reviews on topics such as social and criminal justice issues and many other social science topics, the Collaboration for Environment Evidence (http://www.environmentalevidence.org) and food production and security (http://www.syreaf.org) among others. -->

## <span style="color:#88398A"> Future work</span> 
- Expand functionality to include more meta-analysis packages 
- Include summary results for network meta-analysis.
-  Expand file-structure for reporting and report-writing GitHub repository (separate for each LSR with user login id for collaborators).
- Read-access/interaction mode to latest systematic review  available online in a server.
